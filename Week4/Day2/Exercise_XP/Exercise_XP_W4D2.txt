#Exercise 1
A companyâ€™s financial reports stored in an Excel file. -> Structured
Photographs uploaded to a social media platform. -> Unstructured 
A collection of news articles on a website. -> Unstructured
Inventory data in a relational database. -> Structured
Recorded interviews from a market research study. -> Unstructured

#Exercise 2
- A series of blog posts about travel experiences.-> It should be devided by Country, city and day. We can separete between different experiences like attraction, food and tours.
- Audio recordings of customer service calls. ->  We can organize it by date, toppic, positive or negative, customer name.
- Handwritten notes from a brainstorming session. -> Date, topic or project, relevant or not relevant, have everything digital is a must.
- A video tutorial on cooking. -> Divide them by type of cuisine, dish, ingridientes, difficulty, time requirement.

#Exercise 3
Transaction records -> Structured. 
The info will be used to follow and measure the income and outcome from the company
Also, it can help understand which are the product that are saled the most, peak sales and seasonal variations.
Monitor inventory levels and optimize stock replenishment to avoid stockouts or overstocking.

Customer feedback comments -> Unstructured 
Measure the customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.
Identify common issues or pain points mentioned by customers.
Incorporate feedback into product development processes to enhance offerings and meet customer expectations.

Social media posts about your brand -> Unstructured 
Monitor brand sentiment and track online conversations to understand public perception.
Engage with customers directly by responding to inquiries, comments, and complaints in real-time.
Identify influencers who can amplify positive messaging and promote products.
Analyze engagement metrics to assess the effectiveness of social media marketing campaigns.

Employee work schedules -> Structured
Optimize staffing levels by analyzing historical data to match workforce availability with customers demand.
Forecast labor costs and allocate resources efficiently to minimize understaffing or overstaffing.
Automate scheduling processes to ensure compliance with labor regulations and minimize scheduling conflicts.
Track employee attendance and performance metrics to identify opportunities for training or performance improvement.

#Exercise 6
To generate the dataset, I'll start by strategically measuring vehicle traffic at key points across the city. 
This includes highways, urban streets, residential areas, and commercial districts. 
By collecting data on vehicle count, time of day, and seasonality, I aim to understand how traffic patterns vary throughout the year. 
For instance, I'll investigate whether there are more cars during winter compared to summer, and how weather conditions impact traffic flow.

Furthermore, it's crucial to consider not only the number of vehicles but also occupancy levels. 
I'll gather information on how many people are inside different types of vehicles and whether individuals are using public transportation or alternative modes of commuting. 
This holistic approach will provide insights into overall mobility and transportation choices within the city.

To ensure comprehensive coverage, I'll deploy a combination of data collection methods. 
This includes cameras and AI recognition systems distributed throughout the city, as well as GPS trackers on vehicles or mobile apps for real-time tracking. 
By leveraging these technologies, I can capture detailed information on vehicle movement, average travel times, and congestion hotspots.

The simulated dataset will be integrated with existing traffic management systems and urban planning initiatives. 
This integration will enable us to optimize traffic signal timings, prioritize infrastructure upgrades, and enhance safety measures for pedestrians and cyclists. 
By identifying areas for improvement and implementing data-driven strategies, we can alleviate traffic congestion and enhance overall mobility in the city.

In summary, this approach holds significant potential for mitigating traffic jams and improving public and personal transportation options. 
By leveraging advanced data analytics and simulation techniques, we can drive meaningful improvements in urban mobility and enhance the quality of life for residents.
